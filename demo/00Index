cluster-with-pvalues    use opm and pvclust to calculate clusterings with branch support values
custom-PCA    use opm and BiodiversityR/vegan to draw PCA biplots of Phenotype MicroArray data
multiple-plate-types    apply opm to all CSV files in the working directory to generate HTML, YAML and PDF output
identify-positive-reactions    identify positive reactions and distinguish them from weak or negative reactions
distinguish-curve-topologies    identify significant differences in the curve topology of single curves by bootstrap estimates
phenotype-vs-genotype    compare phenotypic clustering of organisms to their genotypic (phylogenetic) similarity
